How to use DCAS.cpp

1. While in the same directory as the DCAS.cpp file, type "make" into the command line and hit enter(DCAS.cpp should now be compiled).

2. Type "./drone.out" into the command line and the program will execute. The program will print out a world map every time
   something on the map is changed.

3. Key of Symbols:
      "-" : This symbol represents an open position on the map.
      "H" : This symbol represents the Home Base/ Drone Airport and will always be located at position (0,0).
      "G" : This symbol represents the drones goal/ pay load that it is trying to reach.
      "0-9" : The character 0-9 represents the drone.
